# Final_Project_Team_4

## Topic 
Shark Attacks 

## Description of of our source data 
Kaggle Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks

## Questions that we hope to answer
Are there certain scenarios/situations that contribute more towards shark attacks?
(What activity is more likely to contribute to a shark attack?)
(What time/date is likely to contribute to a shark attack?)
### Fatal or not fatal?

## Database: 
Postgres(SQL)

## Machine Learning Models:

## Plan for Dashboard

- Use HTML via Bootstrap

- Logisitic Regression used for first ML model with visual and explanation - drop down pages

*Neural Networks and K Nearest Neighbors to come

#### Logistic Regression: 
This machine learning model is used to find the probability of a certain class or event existing. In our particular model we were looking for a Fatal or Non Fatal event existing within our Shark Attcak dataset. 

#### Neural Networks:

Neural networks are a class of machine learning algorithms used to model complex patterns in datasets using multiple hidden layers and non-linear activation functions.

- Description of project - main page

Predicting Fatal and Non Fatal shark attacks and the other factors leading to those attacks using Machine Learning and Tableau Visualizations.

This Project utilizes HTML, Bootstrap, Tableau, Python (Jupyter Notebook using pandas) Logistic Regression, KNN, and Neural Networks.
