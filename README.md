# Final_Project_Team_4

## Topic 
Shark Attacks 

## Description of of our source data 
Kaggle Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks

## Questions that we hope to answer
Are there certain scenarios/situations that contribute more towards shark attacks?
(What activity is more likely to contribute to a shark attack?)
(What time/date is likely to contribute to a shark attack?)
### Fatal or not fatal?

## Database: 
Postgres(SQL)

## Machine Learning Models:
Logistic Regression

Neural Networks 

K Nearest Neighbors 


## Live Predictions
No.

## Plan for Dashboard

- Use HTML via Bootstrap

- Logisitic Regression used for first ML model with visial and explanation - drop down pages

*Neural Networks and K Nearest Neighbors to come

### Logistic Regression: 
This machine learning model is used to find the probability of a certain class or event existing. In our particular model we were looking for a Fatal or Non Fatal event existing within our Shark Attcak dataset.

   * Acitivty-Fatality Heat map 
   * Month-Hour Heat Map
   * Attacks by Year
   * Spike year and activity
